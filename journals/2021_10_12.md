- How to build and sustain gradeless in an oppressive system
  Inspired by [[Jesse Stommel]] and [[Morris]] I went gradeless a few years ago.
- Several challenges
- [[Students did not understand]]
- No cooperation from uni
- [[Moodle was not ready]] for this style
- [[Had to improvise]]
- [[Build mastery rubric style teaching]]
- Incorporate [[carpentries style]] teaching into thw practice
- Need to learn [[how to create progressive web apps]] to use
- #thoughts It makes no sense to use the Mac OS or Windows app for logseq
-
  $$ \hat{y} = x_1 $$
-
-
-
- $\alpha$
-
  $$\hat{y}=beta_0 + beta_1 * x $$
- ```R
  x <-2
  ```
- this is more of a fleeting note where we put all our thoughts and ideas all day long as we read and work. The non-web connected app on the native system is only useful if we are not connected to the web. This one collects our thoughts throughout the day and if we read something like a pdf and extract information from it also sits there.
- Everything else goes to [[Zotero]] where we will be doing most of our annotation work.
