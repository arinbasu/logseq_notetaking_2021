  An article in New Yorker on the origin of #COVID19
- The furin cleavage site in sars-cov-2 is specific to humams
-
- sars-CoV-2 is the only virus known to possess a furin cleavage site in its section of the coronavirus family tree
- The article summarises the current evidence on the debate between lab leak vs natural apillover origins of covid19. On the natural spillover end, it is possible that due to frequent interactions between humans and animals and encroachment, viruses from bats evolved and spilled over to other aa yet unidentified animals and passed on to humans. On the lab leak end of the spectrum, the viruses were wngineeeed to change their fuurin cleavage sites, leading to highly infectious agents but rhey were not adequately contained and leaked out.
