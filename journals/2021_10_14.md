- How might I use this system to fast track
- Collect resources from all over the web, write first thoughts and random excerpts and notes as fleeting notes here
- Step two: process them and write detailed perm notes either here or separately
- Push all webpages and pdfs to jabref as bibtex but that work needs to be done on a laptop
- Go to the laptop
- Use logseq or obsidian to create the perm notes

	-
- Then push or mix to curvenote or wherever
