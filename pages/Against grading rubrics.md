- Where she says,
- > This is a theme sounded by Maja Wilson in her extraordinary book, Rethinking Rubrics in Writing Assessment.[9]  In boiling “a messy process down to 4-6 rows of nice, neat, organized little boxes,” she argues, assessment is “stripped of the complexity that breathes life into good writing.”  High scores on a list of criteria for excellence in essay writing do not mean that the essay is any good because quality is more than the sum of its rubricized parts.  To think about quality, Wilson argues, “we need to look to the piece of writing itself to suggest its own evaluative criteria” – a truly radical and provocative suggestion

##  Grade range B+ and above:
	- EVERY question must be answered in a clear concise, grammatically correct English
	- ZERO spelling or grammatical error
	- EVERY statement must be backed up by at least two references and they must be properly cited (the EXACT citation style is NOT important, any citation style is accepted as long as they are consistent!)
	- The answer to EVERY question must be factually correct, not a single incorrect fact will be tolerated!
	- Each answer (other than the ones where the student is asked to list studies) MUST contain original thoughts and reflections. The more original the reflections, the higher the grade
	- Answer to each question MUST EXACTLY address what is asked for: if a wrong answer is given, the student will get a 0 for this question
	- For questions 3-10, the minimum word count will be 200 to get a range of grade between B+ and above
