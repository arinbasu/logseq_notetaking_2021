- The summary of Anke Sohren's work is this:
  title:: Summary
- No one should stare at a blank page if they have sets of permanent notes or ideas that are linked with each other
- these ideas will spawn new ideas
- The networked ideas is the paper
- Basically have two troves, one for literature (Jabref) and the other for notes on the papers
- I don't know: looks too time consuming!
- Read then note, then note then note then connect!! fuck!
