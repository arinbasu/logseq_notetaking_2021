- How to use [Jabref](https://jabref.com) as the main reference manager?
- If I use Jabref as the main reference manager, I will be working on Bibtex files mostly
- Read the PDFs and save the annotations somewhere, will Jabref provide that space? Doesn't matter, I can use _this_, "logseq", for this activity. Then mix the annotation from logseq saved with the pdf, and the fleeting thoughts can be channelled to obsidian and obsidian then flows into Curvenote.
- Curvenote will take bibtex anyway, so from curvenote rest of it follows
- Google Scholar also syncs well with  bibtex
- [[Rstudio workflow]] works with bibtex, and I can use pandoc to channel them to Google Docs/Word/wherever
- Jabref has a documentation wiki here: https://docs.jabref.org
