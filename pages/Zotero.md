- Zotero is exclusively for literature notes
- Literature notes are NOT:
	- Just Summaries of the source
	- Summaries + quotes!
	- Tagged
	- Incomplete sentences
	- Not stream of consciousness stuff!
- Literature note ARE:
	- Own words
	- Thoughts that extend the argument
	- Can incorporate the scribblings and notes
	- Scribblings and notes can live in the fleeting notes
	- I need to do a massive cleaning of my Zotero database
- The [[fleeting notes]] and the [[literature notes]] together will form the [[Permanent notes]]
