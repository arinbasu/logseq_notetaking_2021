# Climate Change
- Global warming
- Last twenty years of rapidly increasing temperature
- Brought about due to warming of stratosphere due to accumulation of [[greenhouse gas]]
- Caused due to industrial activity, vehicular emission, lifestock farming, transporation, electricity generation and all activities associated or linked to them
- Leads to loss of polar caps, melting of glaciers in Antarctica, increased volume of water in oceans, flooding of coastal towns, ocean acidification, loss of coral reefs, changes in Coriolis currents leading to increased storms and hurricanes, biodiversity loss, increased heat waves, burning of forests, increaded humidity and temperature around tropics, dry hot summers in the temperate regions, algal bloom in colder water now heated up
- Issues around [[adaptation]] and [[mitigation]]
- Read [[mcmichael paper]] for a review
- Read [[bill mckibben paper]] for a remedy in war footing
