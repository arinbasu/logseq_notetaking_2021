- Book notes on How to take notes
  
  (How to process this: read and cut short to create a literature note in your own words. Remember that a copy of this already exists iin Zotero db; here, the idea is to shorten it to literature note: then mix it and separate ideas are stored in PKM vault of Curvenote)
- Basically he argues that no one writes from a blank sheet of paper.
- Create your own set of notes
- Best way to create notes is to use Zettelkasten method
- Lessons on styles and psychological boosts will not help people to avoid the problem of looking at blank sheets
- Essentially lays the argument here is that if you think and need to connect various pieces together, then you need a structure to do so. It is true for almost all data based disciplines, where connecting diverse worlds is a need. Also true for epidemiology and medicine, etc. (note on p.169)
- Put your ideas in individual slip boxes and connect your ideas with tags and other connections you find and with references. Do that at note-taking level and regularly.
-
- Books and guides that teach students how to write papers fall roughly into two categories.
- The first teaches the formal requirements: style, structure or how to quote correctly.
- And then there are the psychological ones, which teach you how to get it done without mental breakdowns and before your supervisor or publisher starts refusing to move the deadline once more. 
  What they all have in common, though, is that [1] they start with a blank screen or sheet of paper."

- "improving the organisation of all writing makes a difference."
  "process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development." (Ahrens 2017:163)
  Great advice that actual process of writing is a small piece of cog in the machine (note on p.163)
   
  "improvement in the way we organise the everyday writing, how we take notes of what we encounter and what we do with them, will make all the difference for the moment we do face the blank page/screen – or rather not, as those who take smart notes will never have the problem of a blank screen again." (Ahrens 2017:164)

  "Few struggle to text their friends or write emails. The rules of citation can be looked up and there is no way that there are as many mental issues as papers postponed." (Ahrens 2017:165)

  "good, productive writing is based on good note-taking." (Ahrens 2017:165)
  "Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there." (Ahrens 2017:165)
  "quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic." (Ahrens 2017:165)
  "self-help books and study guides can only help you to close the barn door" (Ahrens 2017:165)

  This is an important, if not the most important thing: two slipboxes. So, I do not have to worry about two separate things in Zotero and my Zettlr. Eveything now works. Zotero will be my bibliography slip box and zettle will be my researchbox. (note on p.178)
  
  "he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box." (Ahrens 2017:178)

  Zotero is the bibliography slipbox where anything I read here using pdf or epub or docx or whatever ends up here with its own set of notes. The reference information is already up there written down along with what it connects with and what tags, etc. So this is all good. (note on p.178)
  
  "He then would turn to the main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box." (Ahrens 2017:178)

  So the mainbox will contain notes on what I have read; this could be short notes. From many sources. What I am reading here on the notes here on the pdf stays here but can be ported or notes consulted. Then the thoughts from these sets of notes or summaries go into the zettels that are contained in my Dropbox zettlr folder through zettlr or orgmode. Or even through hackmd or through jupyter notebooks then converted to markdown files and apporpriately id-ed, tagged, connected, referenced.

  "More often than not, a new note would directly follow up on another note and would become part of a longer chain of notes.

  The point to note here is that, everything happens around the notes rather than the book or manuscript or the article level. The notes are separated from their sources but keep the references to the sources intact. Notes then chain together, and therefore do not have to have a specific category structure. One note, one idea and how notes/zettels/idea containers were to be linked up with each other is the issue here. (note on p.178)

  So, the idea here is that use a capture device such as a notebook to capture ideas as they come and write them down. These are fleeting notes. Then there are literatur enotes like the ones I am writing now. Then there are permanent notes that should be written from the fleeting notes and the lit notes but using hte slip box and the zettels. Here one idea per note, brief, own words, and everyone will have id, connections, refs, notes, tags (note on p.183)

  There are severa mistakes people make during note making. Many people simply collect ideas such as fleeting ideas and treat every idea as fleeting idea. Some people use all ideas as important, other people collect ideas and chronologically file them. All of them are useless. We need a filing system of ideas that we can tap into when we want.

  "The slip-box forces us to be selective in reading and note-taking, but the only criterion is the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box. The only thing that matters is that it connects or is open to connections." (Ahrens 2017:233)
  "Collecting only one-sided ideas wouldn’t be very enriching." (Ahrens 2017:233)

  "deliberate practice is demanding" (Ahrens 2017:238)
  "When we try to answer a question before we know how to, we will later remember the answer better, even if our attempt failed (Arnold and McDermott 2013). If we put effort into the attempt of retrieving information, we are much more likely to remember it in the long run, even if we fail to retrieve it without help in the end" (Ahrens 2017:239)
  "Pure re-viewing just doesn’t make any sense, neither for understanding nor for learning. It is debatable if we even can call it learning." (Ahrens 2017:239)
  "best-researched and most successful learning method is elaboration." (Ahrens 2017:239)
  "nstead of in your head, i.e. not learning. On the contrary, it facilitates real, long-term learning. It just means not cramming isolated facts into your brain – something you probably wouldn’t want to do anyway. The objection that it takes too much time to take notes and sort them into the slip-box is therefore short-sighted. Writing, taking notes and thinking about how ideas connect is exactly the kind of elaboration that is needed to learn. Not learning from what we read because we don’t take the time to elaborate on it is the real waste of time. There is a clear division of labour between the brain and the slip-box: The slip-box takes care of details and references and is a long-term memory resource that keeps information objectively unaltered. That allows the brain to focus on the gist, the deeper understanding and the bigger picture, and frees it up to be creative. Both the brain and the slip-box can focus on what they are best at. who seemed to have all information ready to hand." (Ahrens 2017:240)

  Slip boxes are not for just storing information and forgetting it. These are places where you put notes but all notes must be linked. All notes must be written in your own words, preferably handwritten and slowly allowing for typing mistakes. Slowly learn but link everything. Notes are the units of learning exactly as paragraphs are the units of thought. (note on p.240)
  
  "The ability to think beyond the given frames of a text" (Ahrens 2017:241)
  "while inexperienced readers tend to adopt the question of a text and the frames of the argument and take it as a given. What good readers can do is spot the limitations of a particular approach and see what is not mentioned in the text." (Ahrens 2017:241)
  "The technique of writing a certain amount every day was perfected by Anthony Trollope, one of the most popular and productive authors of the 19 th century: He would start every morning at 5:30 a.m. with a cup of coffee and a clock in front of him. Then he would write at least 250 words every 15 minutes. This, he writes in his autobiography: “allowed me to produce over ten pages of an ordinary novel volume a day, and if kept up through ten months, would have given as its results three novels of three volumes each in the year” (Trollope, 2008, 272)." (Ahrens 2017:242)
  "pages per day don’t work that well as a unit when you also have to read, do research and think." (Ahrens 2017:242)
  "Just by writing down these questions and making possible connections explicit in writing are the concepts and theories being investigated. Their limitations become as visible as their particular angle on a problem. By explicitly writing down how something connects or leads to something else, we force ourselves to clarify and distinguish ideas from each other." (Ahrens 2017:247)
  "elaboration through taking smart literature notes increases the likelihood that we will remember what we read in the long term. But this was only the first step." (Ahrens 2017:247)
  "Transferring these ideas into the network of our own thoughts, our latticework of theories, concepts and mental models in the slip-box brings our thinking to the next level." (Ahrens 2017:247)
  "elaborate these ideas within different contexts and connect them with other ideas in a durable fashion." (Ahrens 2017:247)
  "That is why we transfer them into our external memory, the slip-box, with which we have an ongoing dialogue and where they can become part of our active set of ideas." (Ahrens 2017:248)

  very important that the notes in the reference manager gets transferred to the slip box system, other wise the whole system fails. This can be in one of the two forms. You can either write, or you can copy paste and then separate each slip and annotate with id, links, etc as their own zettel. Also, each zettel is connected with each other from the book but now also with the other zettels. Now you have a network of notes quite separate from this book but connected to this book all the same in Zotero. (note on p.248)
  
  "But by elaborating a little bit on this difference and asking the right questions, like “why?” the students can connect this knowledge with prior knowledge, like their understanding of pressure and the function of the heart." (Ahrens 2017:253)

  "first rule is that you can’t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ’em back. If the facts don’t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don’t have them in a usable form. You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience, both vicarious and direct, on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head." (Ahrens 2017:265)
  "When we delegate the storage of knowledge to the slip-box and at the same time focus on the principles behind an idea while we write, add and connect notes, when we look for patterns and think beyond the most obvious interpretation of a note, when we try to make sense of something, combine different ideas and develop lines of thought, we do exactly that: we build up a “latticework of mental models” instead of just “remembering isolated facts and try and bang ’em back.”" (Ahrens 2017:266)
