- At first when I went gradeless, it was difficult for students to understand what I was doing
- I had to write a lot of explanatory notes as to what I was expecting them to do
- One postgraduate student even argued with me in the class that she was more comfortable in the traditional way where she would submit an assignment and then get a grade, never have to look at feedbacks
